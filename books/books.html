    <h1 id="kanzuliman">Kanzul Iman (translation of the Qur'an</h1><hr/>
    <p>Kanzul Iman (Urdu and Arabic: کنزالایمان) is a 1910 Urdu paraphrase translation of the Qur'an by Khan. It is not associated with the Hanafi jurisprudence within Sunni Islam,[22] and is a widely read version of translation in the Indian Subcontinent. It has been subsequently
         translated into English, Hindi, Bengali, Dutch, Turkish, Sindhi, Gujarati and Pashto.[21]</p>

        <h1 id="husamulharamain">Husamul Haramain</h1><hr/>
        <p>Husamul Haramain or Husam al Harmain Ala Munhir kufr wal myvan (The Sword of the Haramayn at the throat of unbelief and falsehood) 1906, is a treatise which declared infidels the founders of the Deobandi, Ahle Hadith and Ahmadiyya movements on the basis that they did not have the proper veneration of the Prophet Muhammad and finality of Prophethood in their writings.[23][24][25][26] In defense of his verdict he obtained confirmatory signatures from 268 traditional Sunni scholars in South Asia,[27] and some from scholars in Mecca and Medina.
             The treatise is published in Arabic, Urdu, English, Turkish and Hindi.[28]</p>
